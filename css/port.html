                    helping turn that into a living breathing entity, from identity through to digital experience.
                    <br><br>My real value comes from years of hands-on experience at a Creative Director level, both
                    leading design in-house, and working independently with startups; uniquely positioning me to provide
                    the kind of holistic design solutions that are typically expected to require a larger design firm.
                    <br><br>I work directly with my clients, who normally hire me for:<br><br>→ Brand Identity
                    Design<br>→ Digital Product / Web Design<br>→ Design/Creative Counsel<br><br>For hands-on projects I
                    only work with one client at a time, so I tend to look for larger, well defined scopes that run for
                    somewhere between 3—6 weeks. These projects are often creating a new visual identity or website from
                    scratch, or a ground-up redesign if what already exists isn’t working.<br><br>I also make myself
                    available in a design advisor capacity which can take shape in a myriad of formats that are helpful
                    to new and growing brands; whether it’s helping to guide a creative vision in the early stages of a
                    project, or providing advice and critiques to in-house teams or third parties. The output of these
                    engagements normally takes the form of verbal feedback followed by written notes.</div>

                    business model nailed down, and know who their audience is, but need someone to craft the visual
                    language around it in a thoughtful, strategic manor, and turn it into a polished brand experience.
                    It’s also normally people that are willing to invest their budget in good design, but perhaps not
                    the overheads and baggage that often comes with a traditional agency format.<br><br>For design
                    counsel engagements it can be a variety of needs; people who don't need to outsource the entirety of
                    a project, they might already have a team but want to augment them with some senior experience, or
                    perhaps they just want an outside perspective during the early stages of a project. Each situation
                    is different, but there’s normally a range of ways I’m able to help with what you’re working on.

                    process. When I’m designing I won’t waste your time or mine showing you a folder full of different
                    arbitrary design directions for the sake of it – you don’t need to see the blooper reel.
                    &nbsp;Instead I’ll move thoughtfully, and efficiently in the most appropriate direction, and iterate
                    on it until we both agree it looks and feels right, and will perform as intended. I believe time
                    spent making elaborate presentations or engaging in unnecessary theatrics is normally better
                    utilised designing.</div>

                    me might cost you. Consider $9k—$15k per week as a rough guideline for my hands-on design, with most
                    of the works showcased on this site taking around 3—6 weeks to complete. Meaning most of my projects
                    end up costing somewhere in the region of ~$30k—$90k. The scope of work, complexity of the problem,
                    and a host of other influences are factored into my pricing, meaning every project is different, and
